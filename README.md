# Opensimdata Landing Page

Minimal folder structure for a simple product landing page and a barebones Hello World page.

## Structure
- `index.html` – landing page
- `hello.html` – minimal Hello World page
- `assets/css/style.css` – basic styling

## Usage
Open `index.html` or `hello.html` directly in your browser.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
- Keep `index.html` and assets at the repo root (as they are now) so Pages serves them correctly.
- Paths are relative (`assets/css/style.css`), so they work at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.
- In GitHub: Settings → Pages → set Source to your branch (`main` or `master`) and Folder to `/ (root)`.
- Optional: add `CNAME` at the repo root if you want a custom domain.
